0.5

(Released on: Wed Sep 1 20:11:13 UTC 2010)

* Add private super classes to ReadModes and WriteModes
  This prevents users from accidentally defining for example:
  'instance ReadModes WriteMode'
  which would defeat the safety guarantees of this package.


0.4.1

(Released on: Sat Aug 14 09:20:51 UTC 2010)

* Added mkIOMode overloaded IOMode constructor
  And added convenience functions:
  withFile', openFile', withBinaryFile' and openBinaryFile'
  that open files without explicitly specifying the IOMode.
  Instead the IOMode is inferred from the type of the resulting Handle
